              The plot shows the trend of house prices and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
              in the various quarters from 2020 to 2023, maintaining the relationship with
              the number of new cases in the analyzed country. The GDP indicates the percentage
              growth rate of real GDP, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations and calendar
              irregularities. It tells you whether the economy is growing or contracting
              compared to the previous quarter, by comparing consecutive periods without
              distortions due to seasonality or calendar variations, as the data has been
              adjusted for both seasonal effects (variations due to holidays, seasonal cycles)
              and calendar differences (e.g., leap years). If the value is positive,
              it means the economy has grown compared to the previous period,
              while if it is negative, it means there has been an economic contraction.
              Meanwhile, the house price provides an overall overview of the real estate
              price trends, showing the percentage change in house prices compared to the
              previous quarter.</p>
            <p class="corpus">
              GDP has experienced more pronounced fluctuations compared to house prices,
              showing greater sensitivity to economic shocks. The data indicates that the
              impact of the pandemic was most evident in the early quarters of 2020, while
              in the following years, a gradual normalization of the economy was observed.

              Due to the pandemic, GDP saw a sharp decline, especially in the first two quarters of 2020,
              with negative values for almost all European countries. In Italy, where the country was under
              lockdown from March 9, 2020, to May 18, 2020, GDP dropped by <span class="text-[#E94F37]">-5.8%</span> in
              the first quarter (Q1)
              and by <span class="text-[#E94F37]">-12.3%</span> in the second quarter (Q2). After the reopening in the
              third quarter (Q3), GDP
              rebounded significantly in many countries (Italy +14.4%, Spain +15.9%, France +15.6%). In general,
              for most countries, from 2021 onwards, a gradual recovery was observed without extreme peaks until 2023.

              Regarding house prices, a different trend can be observed, with greater resilience compared to
              GDP. In Italy, for example, in the second quarter (Q2) of 2020, there was an increase of +3%,
              followed by a slight decrease of <span class="text-[#E94F37]">-2.5% </span>in the third quarter (Q3). In
              the 2021-2023 period,
              the situation varies across different countries: in Italy, moderate fluctuations between positive and
              negative values were recorded,
              while in other countries, such as Luxembourg, a continuous decline in prices has been observed since the
              last quarter of 2023.

              Finally, the data shows that the months with the highest number of new COVID-19 cases were at
              the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. However, likely thanks to the widespread distribution
              of vaccines, these peaks did not lead to prolonged lockdowns or significant declines in GDP
              and house prices, indicating a greater ability of the economy to adapt compared to the early stages
              of the pandemic.

            <p class="corpus">
              The following plot presents data on inbound tourists, represented by the size of the flag,
              in relation to the total number of infected cases (x-axis), expressed as a percentage of
              the population, and the number of vaccinated individuals(y-axis),
              also expressed as a percentage of the population. The data refers to the number of vaccinated
              and infected individuals in that specific year.
            </p>
            <p class="corpus">
              From the plot, it can be observed that from 2020 to 2022, there was a significant increase in infections.
              For instance, countries like France saw a rise from 3.53% in 2020 to 9.61% in 2021, reaching
              44.18% in 2022, which represents a growth of 40.65% from 2020 to 2022. Similar trends are visible in
              countries
              such as Germany and Italy. On the other hand, different trends can be observed in countries like Poland,
              where
              the infection rate increased from 3.38% in 2020 to 7.33% in 2021, followed by a decrease of 1.44% in 2022
              (infection rate in 2022: 5.89%).

              In 2021, most countries recorded a high vaccination rate. For example, Italy (81.26%), France (80.31%),
              Portugal
              (90.16%), and Spain (82.76%) reached very high levels. However, in 2022, the percentage of newly
              vaccinated
              individuals
              dropped drastically, with values around 2-4% in most countries.

              Regarding inbound tourism, what can be observed is that despite the surge in infections in 2022, tourism
              increased in
              countries like France, Italy, and Germany, as well as in most other countries. This was likely facilitated
              by the high
              vaccination rates achieved in 2021, which encouraged the return of tourists. Moreover, it highlights a
              global shift in attitudes towards the virus.

              However, some countries, such as Norway, the Netherlands, and Slovenia, deviated from the general trend,
              experiencing
              stagnant or declining tourism in 2022 despite a pandemic situation similar to other countries. This
              suggests
              that additional factors,
              such as local restrictions or economic conditions, may have played a role.

              The plot presents the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)
              in European countries and indicates the percentage change in
              inflation compared to the same month of the previous year.

              From the values observed it is possible to note a general stability
              between the years of <span class="font-bold">2018</span> and <span class="font-bold">2019</span>, but a
              significant change regarding
              specific sectors such as medical products and transport and fuels and
              lubricants for personal transport equipment, in which, between <span class="font-bold">2018</span> and
              <span class="font-bold">2023</span>
              went from sharply falling prices probably caused by a collapse in demand
              compared to previous years, to a strong increase even above 10%.

            The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the landscape of education and employment in profound ways. In this

              Another assumption we had was that prolonged lockdowns would have significantly impacted tertiary
              enrollment numbers. We anticipated that regions with extended closures would show a negative trend in
              enrollment growth. However, the data above indicates that among the surveyed countries, there has been
              little to no decline in the percentage of tertiary enrollments. This unexpected result suggests that rapid
              adaptations, such as the shift to online learning and the implementation of innovative teaching
              methods, may
              have helped mitigate the potential negative effects of extended lockdown periods. Further analysis could
              explore whether these adaptive strategies have led to long-term improvements in the resilience of higher
              education systems.

            <p class="corpus">
              Our first assumption was that COVID-19 influenced, either positively or negatively, tertiary enrollments,
              primarily due to the
              abrupt shift to remote learning and the economic uncertainty that accompanied the pandemic. A
              further analysis indicates that the overall long-term trend in enrollments is stable and shows
              only minor
              deviations from historical patterns. In some countries, educational enrollment trends changed after
              COVID-19 - such as in <strong>Czechia</strong> - although overall, the trends remained stable.

              Moreover, across Europe, females tend to enroll in higher education more frequently than males. However,
              exceptions exist; for example, in <strong>Germany</strong>, <strong>Greece</strong> and
              <strong>Turkey</strong> on top, the difference is
              minimal. Specifically, in Turkey the gap shrinked afer the pandemic, while in some cases, such as in
              <strong>Cyprus</strong>, the gap between male and female
              enrollments has widened.

              During the early days of the pandemic, nearly every European country saw a sudden increase in unemployment
              as lockdowns forced many businesses to close or reduce operations. This quick rise was particularly
              noticeable in industries like hospitality, tourism, and retail, where job losses happened almost
              overnight. Over time, however, government support, financial aid, and changes in business strategies
              helped the job market stabilize, and by 2023, unemployment rates had started to return to their
              pre-pandemic levels. <br /><br />
              Across Europe, the unemployment picture is a bit more varied. Generally, men experienced slightly higher
              unemployment rates than women, but this was not the case everywhere. For example, in
              <strong>Croatia</strong> and <strong>Cyprus</strong>, there were periods when either men or women were
              more affected by job losses. In <strong>Germany</strong>, the gap is more evident, with men facing
              significantly higher unemployment than women, while in <strong>Greece</strong> and
              <strong>Portugal</strong>, women tended to have higher unemployment rates at times. These differences
              highlight the varied economic and social factors that have shaped the labor market during and after the

              The same trend applies to deaths caused by <span class="text-[#2ca02c]">intentional self-harm</span>, with
              <strong>Germany</strong> again
              showing one of the highest increases: <strong>12.3%</strong>, from <strong>9,104 in 2019 to 10,224 in

              <br><br>
              As for <span class="text-[#1f77b4]">COVID-19</span>, the number of deaths has decreased in most countries,
              peaking in 2021. On average, it
              accounted for <strong>10% of total deaths</strong> that year, though in some countries, such as
              <strong>Slovakia</strong> and <strong>Czechia</strong>, the rate nearly reached <strong>20%</strong>.

            <p class="corpus">It's clear we were right about Germany: the average annual deaths from mental and
              behavioral
              disorders increased by <strong>17.9%</strong>, peaking at an average of <strong>65,854 deaths</strong>
              between 2020 and 2023. Despite this significant number, Germany ranks as the country with the
              second-largest
              percentage increase; the most alarming record belongs to <strong>Portugal</strong>, which saw an increase
              of
              nearly <strong>38%</strong>. <strong>Italy</strong> is the only other country that reported an increase in
              average annual deaths caused by mental and behavioral disorders, rising by <strong>11.8%</strong>.
              <br><br>
              Regarding gender, the data indicates that the male-to-female death ratio for mental and behavioral
              disorders
              has remained largely unchanged before and after COVID-19. However, the same cannot be said for age groups:
              in all countries, the majority of these deaths continue to be concentrated in the 65+ age group, while the
              percentage of deaths among those aged 15-64 has more than doubled across all countries. The highest
              increases were observed in <strong>Germany</strong> (rising from <strong>0.26% to 8.35%</strong>) and
              <strong>The Netherlands</strong> (rising from <strong>0.36% to 7.21%</strong>).
              <br><br>
              While we cannot be 100% certain that COVID-19 had a direct impact on this phenomenon, as other factors may
              also be involved and would require further analysis, we can confidently say that it likely influenced
              these
              trends.

            <p class="corpus text-center mb-2">With the COVID-19 outbreak, health spending increased significantly,
              supported in many countries by additional EU funding. Given this rise in expenditures, let's explore
              whether there is a relationship between each country's health spending and the percentage of deaths
              attributed to mental and behavioral disorders over time.</p>

            <p class="corpus">We observe that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there appeared to be a slight positive
              correlation between health expenditure per capita and the percentage of deaths attributed to mental and
              behavioral disorders. This suggests that countries with higher health spending also reported higher
              percentages of such deaths, while those with lower spending had lower percentages.
              However, post-pandemic data indicates a slight disruption in this pattern, leading to a more scattered
              distribution with no clear correlation. This change may be attributed to various factors, including the
              pandemic's impact on mental health services, shifts in healthcare priorities, and the overall strain on
              healthcare systems. It's important to note that the relationship between health expenditure and mental
              health outcomes is complex and influenced by numerous variables. Further research is necessary to
              understand
              the underlying causes of these observations and to determine the specific impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
              on
              this
              relationship.

            <p class="corpus">The plot shows the values of healthcare spending between
              2020 and 2022 in the various European countries. Each year is represented
              by a single value, while the monthly change reflects the evolution of the
              number of deaths, vaccinated or infected, depending on the selected metric.
              Healthcare spending is indicated by the change in the color scale in the bubbles,
              while their size represents the number of deaths, vaccinations or confirmed cases.
            </p>
            <p class="corpus">
              Looking at the plot, we note that healthcare spending remained relatively
              constant in most countries between 2020 and 2022. However, some notable
              exceptions emerge, such as in the case of Italy. Despite being one of
              the countries with the highest spending, it contributed to <span class="font-bold">79.61% of the
                total deaths</span> until 2022 among the countries considered. This data appears
              disproportionate when compared with the number of infections, which in Italy
              represented <span class="font-bold">64.53% of total cases</span>, compared to other countries such as
              Germany,
              where the percentage of infections was <span class="font-bold">95.46%</span> in 2022.

              This comparison highlights how Italy has recorded a particularly high
              impact in terms of mortality compared to the expenditure incurred and
              the number of infections, suggesting possible differences in the
              effectiveness of health measures, in the organization of the hospital
              system or in the timing of intervention compared to other European countries.</p>
